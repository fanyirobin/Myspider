Facing the box office of the theater, the entrances are on the left and you can clearly see the arcade machine from the outside. A machine to change dollars into coins is on the right upon entering. ,
The machine is upgraded from a SuperNova machine. The machine is fully unlocked and the pads are responsive. The bar for Player 2 is ,very, wobbly. The bar for Player 1 is not as bad as Player 2. ,
The place can get pretty packed on weekends and people tend to take advantage of the crowd to steal things so be cautious on where you place your accessories.,
The employees are nice. The owner tends to upgrade the machine as soon as possible when there's a new release.,
